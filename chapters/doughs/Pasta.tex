	\begin{description}
		\item[100 g] Flour
		\item[1] egg
		\item[pinch] Salt
	\end{description}
\end{multicols}

\section{Preparation}
Mix the shit by hand, and knead it until you are tired. wrap in plastic and leave in the fridge for $2$ hours\sidenote{Italians say half hour, but the dough is often not relaxed making it difficult to open.}.

\section{Experiments}
Substitute the flour for semolina rimacinata, or the eggs for water, depending on what you wanna make with the past.

Dough with water is easier to stretch, so it is a good ideal to make filled past, I guess.

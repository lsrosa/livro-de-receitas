I do not care much about the distinction between Jam, Jelly, etc. Here I'm gathering some interesting combinations.

\section{Purple Onion}

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{description}
		\item[$1\times$] Purple onions
		\item[$0.6\times$] Sugar
		\item[Some] Lemon
	\end{description}
\end{multicols}	

\paragraph*{Preparation}
Pre-boil the onions for \rev{$X~min$} and discard the water\sidenote{If you use Tropea onions, this pre-boiling might not be necessary}.
%
Add the lemon juice, and skin sliced thinly, and sugar in a large pan. Cook until jelly.

\paragraph*{Usage}
On top of cheeses, nice on pizza, could even put on burgers. Breads with savory spreads.

\paragraph*{Experiments}
Try to add orange instead of lemon for the pectin, it should help to reduce the lemon flavor.

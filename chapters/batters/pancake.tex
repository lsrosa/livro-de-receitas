Mix the yolk with all the rest, beat the white till not falling. Fold the white into the batter\sidenote{Yep, it is that easy}.

\section{Baking}

This is the fun part. First, these are those thick girls pancakes, so pour a decent blob of batter on the frying pan.

Second, the frying pan cannot be too hot, neither too cold. If it is too hot you will have several blisters on the pancakes. If its too cold it might stick. The only way to know this is by experience.

Therefore, failure is inevitable, but try to learn the causes and consequences as such you can adapt to different conditions.

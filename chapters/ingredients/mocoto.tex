\section{Preparation}
Bake everything on the pressure cooker for $3$ hours\sidenote{You can bake it in the oven before and then reduce the the pressure cook time. It is a good idea to get tomato past and rub all over the veggies and bones before baking in the oven.}

Strain all the solids and reduce until jelly.

Put in a big pot and put in the fridge overnight. O the next day, remove the fat layer on top, melt it on the fire with a bit of water, and save it in long lasting pots (See Section \ref{pots}).

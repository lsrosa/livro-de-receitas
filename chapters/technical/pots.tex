\section{Ingredients}

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{description}
		\item[x] Glass pots with metal lid
		\item[Some] Stuff you want to preserve
	\end{description}
\end{multicols}	

\section{Preparation}
The stuff you want to preserve must be boiling hot, so it works only with cooked stuff.

Boil the pots and lids for $15$ minutes, add the stuff while super hot and boiling in the pots, and close them.

Return the pots to the boiling water for another $15$ minutes, for extra safety.

Leave the pots to cool down upside down. Store wherever, forever(-ish).
